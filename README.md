A web application for and by alumns of Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science.

The title is not yet official. We don't need to worry about aesteatics until the MVP is done.

## Our aims
- Create a community-run platform for CS50 students to create their own problem sets for extra practice
- Gamify extra practice in programming excersises.
- Expand the portfolio of CS50 alumns.

## TODO:
These are the steps needed to create a minimum viable product (MVP)
- Log in via OAuth
- View problems
- Use check50 to validate
- Submit50 to push solution
- See what you solved
